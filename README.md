# BoosterApplication
NOTE: for runnig node.js server side, it is needed to install express first (npm install express)

NOTE: application is configured to run on localhost port 8080. Some applications can take this port (i.e. skype uses 8080), 
      so it needs to be updated if problem. Also, in Android Studio in Api.kt class, localhost IP address needs to be configured 
      to match current user localhost IP adress in order to work properly. 
      
NOTE: Android application .apk file is provided in Git repository by name: "BoosterApp.apk"

NOTE: In file: "google_maps_api.xml", user needs to provide his Google API Key in order to use Maps!


NOTE: This app is developed in short period of time, and this code should not be used in any production environment. Developing this application for production ready environment would require propper code architecture, project structure and optimization.
